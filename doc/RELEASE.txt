VS2DRT RELEASE NOTES

Version @VERSION@, @VER_DATE@

November 20, 2019
   Updated to version 3.6.0 of PhreeqcRM.

June 2, 2019
   Revised CMake for the compilation of the batch version for Linux or Windows. 
   Previously the logic for using both MPI and OpenMP was not correct. 
   Now, if only the MPI option is specified, only the chemistry calculations 
   are parallelized. If only the OpenMP option is specified, then chemistry 
   and transport are parallelized with OpenMP. If both MPI and OpenMP are 
   specified, then the chemistry is parallelized with MPI and the transport 
   calculations are parallelized with OpenMP.
   
June 1, 2019
   Changed output to screen to be in correct order for the Linux batch version. 
   Previously, Linux screen output could be jumbled because of buffering.
   
May 16, 2019
    Updated batch version of VS2DRT for Windows or Linux. The .tar.gz distribution 
	file has source	code, documentation, and examples, but no executables. The 
	program can be compiled (on Linux or Windows) with CMake (3.10 or newer).
	There are CMake options for parallization with OpenMP and (or) MPI.

    Corrected flux output. Parallelization had caused the flux calculations to 
	be erroneous. Now, the proper coefficients are saved to be able to calculate
	correct fluxes in the output (vs2drt.out).
