Solute example 4 is a one-dimensional problem that involves solute transport
through a 35-cm deep column with decay and linear adsorption.  The problem is identical
to Verification Problem 5 in USGS Water-Resources Investigations
Report 90-4025. Initial solute concentration in the column is 0. From time = 1 to 
160 seconds, water with a concentration of 10 infiltrates the top of 
the column at a velocity of 0.1 cm/s. Infiltration occurs at the same rate for
time 160 to 480 seconds, but now the infiltrating water has a concentration of 0.
The decay constant is 0.01 per second, the equilibrium distribution 
coefficient is 0.3 /cm**3/g, and the bulk density is 1.587 g/cm**3.
