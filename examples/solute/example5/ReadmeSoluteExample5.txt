Solute example 5 is a variation of flow example 3,
simulation of flow through a 5-m long 
column of fine sand. The top boundary is treated as a constant
pressure head, and the bottom boundary is a gravity drain. 
Initial concentrations within the column are zero. 
Three recharge periods with three different top boundary 
pressure heads and concentrations are simulated.
