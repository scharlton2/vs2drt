Solute example 3 is a two-dimensional problem that involves solute transport,
evaporation, and plant transpiration.  The vertical section is a sandy clay loam
with a discontinuous layer of silt loam.  Initial solute concentration is nonzero
only in the vicinity of the toe of the slope on the upper boundary.  A
series of 21 recharge periods is simulated.  These alternate between 30 days
of evaporation and 2 days of infiltration of solute-free water.  The purpose 
of this simulation is to track the movement of solute in response to evaporation
and infiltration.
