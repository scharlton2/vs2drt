Solute example 1 is borrowed from USGS Water-Resources Investigations Report
90-4025 (p. 45). It involves one-dimensional infiltration of water with a solute 
concentration of 1. into column of partially saturated sandy loam that initially
contains solute-free water.  The column is 40 cm in height.  Uniform spacing (1 cm)
and time step size (0.005 hr) are used.  Initial pressure heads are set to -120 cm.
Water is applied to the top of the column at the rate of 5.5 cm/hr for a period of
0.5 hr.
