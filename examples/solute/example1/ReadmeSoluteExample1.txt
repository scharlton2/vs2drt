Solute example 1 is borrowed from USGS Water-Resources Investigations Report
90-4025 (p. 45). It involves one-dimensional infiltration of water with a chloride
concentration of 1 g/m**3 (1 mg/L) into column of partially saturated sandy loam 
that initially contains water with a chloride concentration of 0.  The column 
is 0.4 m in height.  Uniform spacing (0.01 m) and time step size (5 sec) are used.  
Initial pressure heads are set to -1.20 m. Water is applied to the top of the column 
at the rate of 1.53e5 m/sec for a period of 1,800 sec.
