Solute example 2 is the verification problem given in USGS Water-Resources Investigations
Report 90-4025 (p. 36-37).  It involves fluid injection from a well in a fully saturated confined
aquifer. Axial symmetry is assumed, and radial coordinates are used.  Initial solute concentration
within the aquifer is 0; the concentration of the injected water is 1.  Initial heads in the
aquifer were 10m.  Pressure head at the radial extent of the domain was fixed at this value.
Injection occurred at a rate of 225 cubic meters/hr for 2000 hours.
