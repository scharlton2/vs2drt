Solute example 2 is the verification problem given in USGS Water-Resources Investigations
Report 90-4025 (p. 36-37).  It involves fluid injection from a well in a fully saturated confined
aquifer. Axial symmetry is assumed, and radial coordinates are used.  Initial chloride concentration
within the aquifer is 0; the chloride concentration of the injected water is 1 g/m**3 (1 mg/L).  
Initial heads in the aquifer were 10m.  Pressure head at the radial extent of the domain was fixed 
at this value. Injection occurred at a rate of 225 cubic meters/hr for 2000 hours.
