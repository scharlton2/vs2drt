Flow example 3 is a simulation of flow through a 5-m long 
column of fine sand. The top boundary is treated as a constant
pressure head, and the bottom boundary is a gravity drain. 
Three recharge periods with three different top boundary 
pressure heads are simulated.  By the end of each recharge
period the flow pattern is nearly steady.
