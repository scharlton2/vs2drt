Flow example 1 examines flow through an earthen dam.  Initially, the
reservoir above the dam is empty and an equilibrium pressure head
profile is assumed with the water table at the base of the dam.  At
time 0, the reservoir is instantly filled to a height of 10 feet.  The
high side of the dam is treated as a constant total head boundary; the
low side is a potential seepage face.  The simulation has a single
recharge period that lasts 2000 days.  During that time span, much of
the dam becomes saturated.  The simulation does not quite reach
steady-state flow at 2000 days.
