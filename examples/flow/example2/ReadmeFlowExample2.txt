Flow example 2 is a simulation of flow through a section of
a laboratory sand box, 2.5 m in length.  The bottom and side
boundaries are impermeable.  The top boundary slopes upward
from a height of 0.2 m at x = 0 to a height of 1 m at x = 1.5.  The 
rightmost 1 m of the top boundary is at a uniform height of 1 m
and is treated as an infiltration boundary.  The slope is
a potential seepage face.  The box is filled with medium sand
except for a thin layer of fine sand at a height of 0.6 to 0.7
feet.  The simulation runs for 21,600 sec.
