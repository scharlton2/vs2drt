The tutorial example is a two-dimensional problem that involves energy
and solute transport.  The vertical section is a fine sand
with a discontinuous layer of silt. The top boundary contains an 
ephemeral stream bed. The simulation tracks the movement of water, heat,
and chloride from the stream bed through the unsaturated zone. 
Initial chloride concentration is zero at all points, and initial temperature
ranges between 12 degrees C at the bottom to 20 degrees C at the top. 
Two recharge periods are simulated. During the first recharge period, water
infiltrates from the stream bed, and during the second, the stream bed is dry,
and water, heat, and chloride are redistributed.
