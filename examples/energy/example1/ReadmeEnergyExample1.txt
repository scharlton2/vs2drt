Energy example 1 is a modification of the example problem given in
USGS Water-Resources Investigations Report 96-4230 (p. 26).  It
involves one-dimensional flow of water in the unsaturaed zone in
response to a ponded surface that is maintained at a height of 0.0405
m and a temperature of 17.48 degrees Celsius.  The length of the
column is 49.6 m, and the simulated duration of the experiment in 100
hours.  Initial temperatures within the column are 21.3 degrees;
initial pressure heads are -0.7497 m.  The pond at the surface is
maintained at 0.0405 m.
