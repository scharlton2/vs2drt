Energy example 3 simulates 5 days of injection to an unconfined
aquifer followed by 25 days of equilibration.  Radial coordinates are
used.  The radial extent of the domain in 800 m; the height of the
domain is 100 m.  The injection well is located at radius = 0 m and is
screened between the depths of 40 and 50 m.  Injection of water at a
temperature of 40 degrees Celsius occurs at a rate of 800 cubic meters
per day.  The top boundary of the domain represents land surface and
is treated as a no-flow boundary with a fixed temperature of 10
degrees (this is also the intial temperature at all points within the
domain) The bottom of the domain is treated as being impermeable and
is also assigned a fixed temperature of 10 degrees.  The radial
boundary is a fixed total head on the lower portion and a potential
seepage face on the upper portion.
