Energy example 2 is the verification problem given in
USGS Water-Resources Investigations Report 96-4230 (p. 5).
The problem simulates heated water flowing into a one-dimensional
saturated column of cool water.  Vertical spacing is uniform at 1.0 m.
The total length of simulated time is 10765 s.  Initial column
temperature is 20 degrees Celsius.  Temperature of the inflowing
water is 21 degrees.
